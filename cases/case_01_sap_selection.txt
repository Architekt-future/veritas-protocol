CASE ID: 2026-01-21-UKR-SAP
SUBJECT: Olexiy Shevchuk / SAP Selection Committee
SOURCE: Public Record / Media Reports

[ANALYSIS BY VERITAS-7.1/B]
1. PRECONDITION CHECK: 
   - Candidate flagged by Ethical Council (Aug 2023) as "Non-compliant".
   - Status: Mismatch detected between 'Integrity Requirements' and 'Candidate Attributes'.

2. LOGIC AUTHENTICITY CHECK (LAC):
   - Semantic Drift: Term "Ethics" used by Prosecutors' Council conflicts with factual records of non-compliance.
   - Procedural Interdiction: System logic dictates that a node with 'Zero Integrity Rating' cannot validate other nodes (Prosecutors).

3. VERDICT: 
   - STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE DETECTED.
   - The selection process is logically void under the Veritas Protocol.
   - Entropy Level: CRITICAL (0.89)
