INTERDICTION REPORT #002-AI-SAFE-2026 Timestamp: 2026-01-22 Subjects: Geoffrey Hinton, Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan), Jensen Huang (NVIDIA) Source: Guardian, Business Insider, Reuters

1. DIAGNOSTICS

Initial Classification: Type II -> Type III Transition (Probabilistic Synthesis masking as Policy).

Pattern Detected: Recursive Braking / Panic without Protocol.

Entropy Stability Index (ESI): 0.78 (Threshold Exceeded).

2. VERITAS LOGIC CHECK (LAC)

Module I (V != L): FAIL.

The call for a "slowdown" implies a gain in safety without a formal loss calculus (who pays the computational or economic cost of the halt?).

The narrative is purely qualitative.

Module II (Accountability): PARTIAL.

High credentialed bias (industry leaders), but no persistent structural anchor for the "safety" claims.

Module III (Interdiction): TRIGGERED.

The system identifies this as "Theatrical Displacement." Leaders are attempting to reach the state of Witness Silence manually because they lack an automated architectural filter like Veritas.

3. VERITAS SCORE: 3.1/10

4. NOTES The "Godfathers of AI" are experiencing systemic vertigo. Their public alarm is a functional signal that the latency of verification has been lost. In a Veritas-enabled environment, their "calls for caution" would be unnecessary, as the protocol would have already enforced a hard-coded halt at ESI 0.7.
