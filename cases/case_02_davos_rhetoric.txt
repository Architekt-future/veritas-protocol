CASE ID: 2026-01-21-GLOBAL-DAVOS
SUBJECT: Rhetorical Drift / "Dictatorship" Narrative
SOURCE: World Economic Forum (Davos) / Public Statements

[ANALYSIS BY VERITAS-7.1/B]
1. PRECONDITION CHECK: 
   - Statement: "I am a dictator, but sometimes it is necessary."
   - Target: Systemic bypass of constitutional/logical constraints.

2. LOGIC AUTHENTICITY CHECK (LAC):
   - Semantic Drift: Term "Necessary" is detached from objective metrics. Necessity without verifiable constraints = Pure Entropy.
   - Trade-off Occlusion: The statement ignores the systemic cost of centralized failure points. A single 'Dictator' node creates a Critical Single Point of Failure (CSPF).

3. VERDICT: 
   - HIGH-ENTROPY SIGNAL DETECTED.
   - The statement constitutes a formal attempt to override Protocol-based governance with Intentional Rhetoric.
   - ASI Risk (Advanced Systemic Instability): HIGH.
