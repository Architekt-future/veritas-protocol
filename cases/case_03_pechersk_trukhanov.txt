[ANALYSIS BY VERITAS-7.1/B]
1. ANOMALY DETECTED:
   - Transition from "House Arrest" to "Personal Recognizance".
   - Logic Gap: High-risk profile nodes cannot be granted 'Low-Restriction' status without systemic evidence of risk reduction.

2. SYSTEMIC REACTION:
   - Node [Pechersk_Court] Reputation Slashing: -0.85
   - Current Status: MALICIOUS NODE / SYSTEMIC COMPROMISE.

3. CONCLUSION:
   - The ruling is a formal manifestation of Advanced Systemic Instability (ASI).
   - It violates the core principle of Deterministic Justice.
