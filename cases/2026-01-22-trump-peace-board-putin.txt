INTERDICTION REPORT #005-TRUMP-PUTIN-2026 Timestamp: 2026-01-22 Subject: Invitation of Vladimir Putin to Trump’s "Board of Peace" Source: BBC, Reuters, Al Jazeera

1. DIAGNOSTICS

Initial Classification: Type IV (Semantic Noise) / Recursive Ritualism.

Pattern Detected: Moral Decoupling / Institutional Displacement.

ESI (Entropy Stability Index): 0.96 (SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE).

Adjectival Density: "Historic", "Innovative", "Unprecedented" (Ratio 22:1).

2. VERITAS LOGIC CHECK (LAC)

Module I (V != L): FAIL.

Claim: Integrating an aggressor into a peace-governing body creates "stability."

Violation: Zero-cost accountability. The invitation cancels the "Loss" (L) associated with the invasion, creating an infinite "Value" (V) vacuum. The equation is broken.

Module II (Accountability): CRITICAL FAILURE.

The invitation ignores the ICC warrant (Accountability Anchor). The protocol detects a "Ghost Signature" — an attempt to act as a legal entity while being outside the legal substrate.

Module III (Interdiction): TOTAL LOCKDOWN.

The Veritas Protocol identifies the "Board of Peace" as a Replacement Substrate. It is an attempt to create a "New UN" where logic is replaced by personal consensus.

3. VERITAS SCORE: 1.1 / 10

4. NOTES This is the ultimate test for the Veritas Protocol. We are witnessing the birth of a "Post-Logical Diplomacy." The UK and France’s refusal to join (citing "legal concerns") is a desperate attempt by legacy substrates to maintain ESI below 0.7. Putin’s offer of $1 billion (from frozen assets) is a "Semantic Paradox": using stolen/frozen funds to buy a seat at the table of peace. Recommendation: Witness Silence. Any participation in this discourse increases global entropy.
