# Technical Architecture: LAC & Wave-Ocean Principle

## 1. Logic Authenticity Check (LAC)
The LAC engine is designed to measure the delta between symbolic representation and logical consistency. 
Formula: $V \neq L$ (where $V$ is the qualitative volume and $L$ is the logical substrate).

## 2. Wave-Ocean Principle
- **The Surface (Wave):** High-entropy informational noise, emotional adjectives, and propaganda.
- **The Deep (Ocean):** The underlying ground truth and deterministic facts.
The protocol acts as a sonar, filtering surface noise to reach the deep substrate.

## 3. Implementation
The current version utilizes the `veritas_core.py` module to calculate entropy density based on semantic markers.
