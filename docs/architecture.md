# Technical Architecture

## Logic Authenticity Check (LAC)
The primary engine implemented in `veritas_core.py`. It evaluates the semantic density of text to identify "Adjective Overload" vs "Logical Anchors."

## Reputation Economy
Implemented in `veritas_economy_proto.py`. It creates a circular flow where informational entropy results in capital loss, while logical consistency provides rewards.

## Data Structure
- **Core:** Algorithmic filtering.
- **Economy:** Incentive alignment.
- **Cases:** Empirical feedback loop.
