# Ethical Framework & AI Co-authorship

## AI as a Witness
In Veritas Protocol, AI is utilized as a "Witness" rather than a "Judge." Its role is to highlight logical anomalies for human verification.

## Legal Precedent
This project recognizes AI as a legitimate co-author and ethical agent, aligned with the principles discussed in the context of Digital Sovereignty and Article IX of the conceptual legal framework.

## Neutrality
The protocol is designed to be substrate-agnostic and politically neutral, focusing strictly on logical consistency regardless of the narrative source.
