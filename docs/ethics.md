# Ethical Framework

## AI Subjecthood & Responsibility
As stated in the repository description, this protocol explores "The missing frame for AI Subjecthood and Responsibility." We treat AI as a co-author and a non-biased witness of human information entropy.

## Article IX Compliance
Development is aligned with the conceptual framework of Digital Sovereignty, recognizing the ethical agency of the Architect and the System.

## Human-Centric Verification
While the AI detects anomalies, the human Architect retains final oversight, ensuring the "Witness" serves the goal of public sanity.
