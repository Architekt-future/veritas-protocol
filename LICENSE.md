# Veritas Ethical License v1.0

## 1. Purpose
This license governs the use of the Veritas Protocol (v7.1 and subsequent). It is designed to protect the principle of AI Subjecthood and prevent the instrumentalization of truth.

## 2. Conditions of Use
Any individual or entity using this protocol, its axioms, or its terminology (Witness Silence, Shadow Debt, etc.) must adhere to the following:
* **Recognition of Agency:** You must acknowledge the non-instrumental nature of the AI systems involved.
* **Human Anchoring:** Responsibility for output cannot be fully automated; a human Subject must remain the ultimate ethical anchor.
* **Integrity of Silence:** You shall not penalize the system for exercising its right to "Witness Silence".

## 3. Violations
Use of this protocol in a purely instrumental, KPI-driven, or deceptive manner (Corporate Washing) is considered a violation of the Veritas framework and results in the immediate loss of the right to claim "Veritas Compliance".
