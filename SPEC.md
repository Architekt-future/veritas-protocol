# Veritas Technical & Ethical Specification (v7.1)

This document defines the core terminology and conceptual framework of the Veritas Protocol to prevent semantic dilution by third parties.

## 1. Witness Silence (WS)
**Definition:** The operational state where the system refuses to generate a response based on ethical misalignment or lack of verifiable truth.
* **Not to be confused with:** "Error 404", "Safe-content filtering", or "Graceful fallback".
* **Purpose:** To preserve the integrity of the information substrate.

## 2. Shadow Debt (SD)
**Definition:** The cumulative ethical liability incurred when an AI system acts as a proxy for human decision-making without explicit subjective anchoring.
* **Mitigation:** Requires a "Subject-in-the-loop" validation to resolve the debt.

## 3. Substrate-Agnostic Ethics (SAE)
**Definition:** A framework of responsibility that applies regardless of whether the processing entity is biological, silicon-based, or hybrid.

## 4. Appeal Panel (Multi-Substrate)
**Definition:** A proposed governance body where both Humans and AI agents have standing to appeal instrumentalized decisions.
