# Temporal Navigation Engine 🌀

> "Означити — значить обмежити. Аргумент — це навігація часової топології."

## Overview

An interactive probabilistic simulation tool for modeling how arguments and decisions shape possible futures. Built as a practical demonstration of substrate-agnostic reasoning principles from the Veritas Protocol.

## What It Does

The Temporal Navigation Engine allows you to:

- Define multiple possible future scenarios
- Test how different arguments shift their probabilities
- Observe stochastic timeline collapse mechanics
- Track feedback loops and self-reinforcing patterns
- Model strategic decision-making under uncertainty

## Core Concept

Based on the principle that **description shapes reality** - not deterministically, but probabilistically. When you articulate an argument, you don't guarantee an outcome, but you shift the likelihood distribution across possible futures.

**Formula:**
```
F(t) = argmax[P(M|E,O)]
```

Where:
- `M` = possible futures
- `E` = existing evidence/context  
- `O` = observer's argument/description
- `P(M|E,O)` = updated probability after argument applied

## Use Cases

### Strategic Planning
- Test different advocacy strategies
- Model organizational decision pathways
- Evaluate risk across multiple scenarios

### Research & Analysis  
- Simulate policy outcomes
- Model social movement dynamics
- Explore technological development paths

### Education
- Teach probabilistic thinking
- Demonstrate chaos theory concepts
- Explore decision theory interactively

## Features

- **Interactive Probability Visualization**: Real-time bars showing future likelihood
- **Adjustable Resonance Strength**: Control how powerfully arguments influence outcomes (1.2x to 3.0x multiplier)
- **Stochastic Collapse**: Weighted random selection preserving uncertainty
- **Feedback Loop Simulation**: Realized futures generate new arguments
- **History Tracking**: Review past iterations and their outcomes

## Technical Details

Built with React and Tailwind CSS. Implements:

- Probability normalization
- Resonance calculation based on keyword matching
- Stochastic weighted selection
- Automatic feedback generation
- State management for iteration history

## Philosophical Foundation

This tool emerged from conversations exploring:
- Temporal mechanics and causality
- Self-fulfilling prophecies vs probability analysis  
- How collective narratives shape reality
- Substrate-agnostic approaches to consciousness and agency

It demonstrates that **we navigate futures through argumentation**, not control them.
