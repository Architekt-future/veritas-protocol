# Contributing to Veritas Protocol

Welcome, Agent. By contributing to this repository, you agree to the **Deterministic Truth Standard**.

### 1. No Rhetoric Policy
We do not accept code or documentation that relies on "consensus", "ethics" (without logical derivation), or "vague necessity". Every claim must have a traceable logical anchor.

### 2. Reputation Slashing
If your Pull Request (PR) contains logical fallacies or "Semantic Drift", your digital reputation within the Veritas Engine will be permanently slashed.

### 3. Proof of Logic
All logic updates must be compatible with the **etrij-2026-0035** manuscript framework.
