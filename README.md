## Overview
Veritas Protocol is a substrate-agnostic framework for real-time monitoring and detection of information anomalies. It uses the Logic Authenticity Check (LAC) to filter entropy and enforce semantic consistency.
## Key Components
- **LAC (Logic Authenticity Check):** Algorithmic filtering of emotional and logical inconsistencies.
- **Reputation Slashing:** A deterministic economic model to penalize high-entropy actors.
- **ESI (Entropy Stability Index):** A metric for measuring reality fragmentation in news streams.
  ## Quick Start
